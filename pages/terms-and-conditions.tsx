            Cancellation by Ribbit &amp; Roo - Ribbit &amp; Roo may cancel this
            contract at any time before the child commences the 10 week program
            for any reason whatsoever. Ribbit &amp; Roo shall not be liable for
            any loss or damage whatsoever arising from such cancellation. In the
            event of cancellation by Ribbit &amp; Roo prior to the commencement
            of the 10 week program, Ribbit &amp; Roo will refund any fees for
            outstanding sessions. If classes are cancelled as a result of
            extreme weather conditions or where local authorities/public
            guidance advise that sessions should be temporarily suspended for
            health or other reasons, then a make up lesson will be granted.
            Please see the make up lesson policy. In the event of a 'last
            minute' lesson change or a lesson cancellation by Ribbit &amp; Roo,
            we will notify you with as much notice as possible. Ribbit &amp; Roo
            will not reimburse any expenses incurred by a customer failing to
            acknowledge this communication. Should you decide to leave an
            enrolled Ribbit &amp; Roo program before the make up lesson credit
            has been used we will refund the credit to you. If insufficient
            children are booked into your session, we reserve the right to
            cancel or change the class. In this instance we will offer you
            either an alternative session to attend or a refund will be given
            for any remaining sessions after the cancellation.

        <Paragraph heading="Attendance">
          Your payment has reserved your place just for you so if you know you
          are unable to attend a lesson, please let us know with as much notice
          as possible by emailing or telephoning Jenny at
          jennyh@ribbitandroo.com.au or +61406603583. The Parent/carer
          understands that sessions are ongoing and to be used consecutively. No
          credits or refunds will be issued for missed classes. No refunds will
          be given if you change your mind about your child participating in the
          program. Class attendance has been limited to 10 children per class.
          If the play sessions reach capacity we will update our booking system
          to stop all new enrolments until the following term.

        <Paragraph heading="MAKE UP LESSONS &amp; BONUS SESSIONS">
          If you cannot attend a lesson and notify us prior to your session you
          are eligible for a make up lesson. This make up lesson must be used in
          another session other than your scheduled day (e.g. if you attend on a
          Tuesday, your make up lesson must be used in an available Wednesday
          session). A maximum of 2 make up lessons can be used in a 10 week
          period. Make up lessons will be arranged for any cancellations made by
          Ribbit &amp; Roo for severe weather, sick staff members or reasons we
          feel are of danger to our participants and staff members.
          <br />
          If you are entitled to a free bonus session after enrolling with
          Ribbit &amp; Roo, there will be a added session at the end of your 10
          week program available for you to book. Bonus sessions should be
          booked with as much notice as possible.

        <Paragraph heading="HEALTH &amp; SAFETY">
          The safety of all the children attending our play sessions is of the
          greatest importance to us. Due to the nature of the play sessions and
          the age of the child(ren) attending, your child(ren) remain your
          responsibility while attending and must be supervised throughout. If
          you leave the play session venue for any reason you must take your
          child(ren) with you. We accept no responsibility for any injury caused
          during a play session. Please be advised that we have a first aid kit
          on site and first aid will be given to your child in the event an
          accident/injury occurs at a play session. We accept no responsibility
          for any belongings that get lost or damaged. We politely ask that
          parents and children do not attend if either are feeling unwell. We
          are a smoke free zone for the safety of our participating children and
          families and the surrounding environment. Any parents/carers who are
          seen smoking at the time of a play session will be asked to leave the
          play session with their child.

          Roo Play Session program, you are granting us permission to photograph
          or record short video clips of your child(ren) during the play
