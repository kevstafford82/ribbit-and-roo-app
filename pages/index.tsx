            by registering using our registration form. You must provide us with
            the specific information we need in order to enrol in a session with
            us. During the enrolment process, you will be asked to read and

            Cancellation by Ribbit &amp; Roo - Ribbit &amp; Roo may cancel this
            contract at any time before the child commences the 10 week program
            for any reason whatsoever. Ribbit &amp; Roo shall not be liable for

            event of cancellation by Ribbit &amp; Roo prior to the commencement
            of the 10 week program, Ribbit &amp; Roo will refund any fees for
            outstanding sessions. If classes are cancelled as a result of
            extreme weather conditions or where local authorities/public
            guidance advise that sessions should be temporarily suspended for
            health or other reasons, then a make up lesson will be granted.
            Please see the make up lesson policy. In the event of a 'last
            minute' lesson change or a lesson cancellation by Ribbit &amp; Roo,
            we will notify you with as much notice as possible. Ribbit &amp; Roo

            enrolled Ribbit &amp; Roo program before the make up lesson credit
            has been used we will refund the credit to you. If insufficient
            children are booked into your session, we reserve the right to
            cancel or change the class. In this instance we will offer you
            either an alternative session to attend or a refund will be given
            for any remaining sessions after the cancellation.

            If you cannot attend a lesson and notify us prior to your session
            you are eligible for a make up lesson. This make up lesson must be
            used in another session other than your scheduled day (e.g. if you
            attend on a Tuesday, your make up lesson must be used in an
            available Wednesday session). A maximum of 2 make up lessons can be
            used in a 10 week period. Make up lessons will be arranged for any
            cancellations made by Ribbit &amp; Roo for severe weather, sick
            staff members or reasons we feel are of danger to our participants
            and staff members.
            <br />
            If you are entitled to a free bonus session after enrolling with

          <p className="mb-8">
            The safety of all the children attending our play sessions is of the
            greatest importance to us. Due to the nature of the play sessions
            and the age of the child(ren) attending, your child(ren) remain your
            responsibility while attending and must be supervised throughout. If
            you leave the play session venue for any reason you must take your
            child(ren) with you. We accept no responsibility for any injury
            caused during a play session. Please be advised that we have a first
            aid kit on site and first aid will be given to your child in the
            event an accident/injury occurs at a play session. We accept no
            responsibility for any belongings that get lost or damaged. We
            politely ask that parents and children do not attend if either are
            feeling unwell. We are a smoke free zone for the safety of our
            participating children and families and the surrounding environment.
            Any parents/carers who are seen smoking at the time of a play
            session will be asked to leave the play session with their child.
