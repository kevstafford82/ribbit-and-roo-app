Due to the nature of the play sessions and\n          the age of the child(ren) attending, your child(ren) remain your\n          responsibility while attending and must be supervised throughout. If\n          you leave the play session venue for any reason you must take your\n          child(ren) with you. We accept no responsibility for any injury caused\n          during a play session. Please be advised that we have a first aid kit\n          on site and first aid will be given to your child in the event an\n          accident/injury occurs at a play session. We accept no responsibility\n          for any belongings that get lost or damaged. We politely ask that\n          parents and children do not attend if either are feeling unwell. We\n          are a smoke free zone for the safety of our participating children and\n          families and the surrounding environment. Any parents/carers who are\n          seen smoking at the time of a play session will be asked to leave the\n          play session with their child.\n        </Paragraph>\n        <Paragraph heading=\"PHOTOGRPAHY &amp; SOCIAL MEDIA\">\n          Please be aware that by enrolling your child(ren) in any Ribbit &amp;\n          Roo Play Session program, you are granting us permission to photograph\n          or record short video clips of your child(ren) during the play\n          sessions that we may use for Ribbit &amp; Roo promotional purposes on\n          our social media and/or website.
